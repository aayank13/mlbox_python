# ML Box

This is the python (machine learning) code for our project.

We've developed the MLBox platform entirely in-house, without relying on any third-party APIs such as ChatGPT. Our goal is to provide a fully indigenous solution, ensuring complete control over the platform's functionality and performance.

In traditional AI model generation:
It requires extensive coding knowledge and data science expertise.
Domain knowledge is required.
Require resources with high performance capabilities.

ML Box addresses these challenges by providing a no-code solution, simplifying the entire process of AI model generation.

Its purpose is to bridge the gap between data, Model Training and Deployment
